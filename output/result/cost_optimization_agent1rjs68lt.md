| Category | Check | Status | Notes | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Resource Utilization** | Identify idle or underused compute/storage | Unknown | The diagram does not provide usage metrics. In a serverless architecture, "idle" compute is minimized by design (Lambda, API Gateway). However, over-provisioned resources are still possible. | **Amplify:** Review unused environments/branches. **API Gateway:** Monitor request rates; consider deleting unused API endpoints or stages. **Lambda:** Analyze CloudWatch metrics (invocations, duration, memory utilization) to right-size memory allocation and identify unused functions. **DynamoDB:** Monitor RCU/WCU utilization, identify inactive tables, and assess storage growth. |
| **1. Resource Utilization** | Flag duplicated or redundant services | Not Applicable | The provided architecture diagram does not show any obvious duplication or redundancy of services within this specific flow. It represents a single, streamlined serverless path. | No immediate recommendation for redundancy, as the current design is lean. If similar functionalities exist in other parts of the system, assess for consolidation. |
| **2. Pricing Models** | Recommend reserved or spot instances vs on-demand | Not Applicable | This architecture is entirely serverless (Amplify, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB). Reserved Instances and Spot Instances are primarily for EC2, RDS, and similar services, which are not present here. | N/A |
| **2. Pricing Models** | Suggest storage tiering or lifecycle policies | Needs Investigation | DynamoDB offers a single storage tier by default (Standard). DynamoDB Standard-IA tables are available for infrequently accessed data. Lifecycle policies are mainly for S3, not directly applicable to DynamoDB main storage, though backups have retention policies. | **DynamoDB:** Evaluate data access patterns. For infrequently accessed items or tables, consider using DynamoDB Standard-IA tables if applicable to reduce storage costs. Implement backup retention policies to manage backup storage costs. |
| **3. Tagging & Budgeting** | Check for cost allocation tags | Unknown | The diagram does not provide information about tagging strategies. | Implement a comprehensive tagging strategy (e.g., by project, environment, owner) across all AWS resources (Amplify apps, API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables) to enable detailed cost allocation and accountability. |
| **3. Tagging & Budgeting** | Verify budget alerts or cost monitoring configured | Unknown | The diagram does not provide information about budget or cost monitoring configurations. | Configure AWS Budgets with appropriate alerts for estimated and actual costs. Utilize AWS Cost Explorer for detailed cost analysis and identify spending trends or anomalies. Set up Cost and Usage Report (CUR) delivery to S3 for granular data analysis. |
| **4. Automation** | Ensure autoscaling or scheduling is used to minimize idle time | Mostly Automated | AWS Amplify, API Gateway, and Lambda are serverless and automatically scale based on demand, effectively eliminating idle compute costs. DynamoDB in On-Demand capacity mode also scales automatically. If DynamoDB is in Provisioned capacity mode, auto-scaling should be configured. | **DynamoDB:** If using Provisioned capacity mode, ensure Auto Scaling is configured for both Read Capacity Units (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU) to scale capacity dynamically with demand and prevent over-provisioning during low usage periods. |
| **4. Automation** | Suggestions for consolidated billing benefits if any | Not Applicable | The diagram shows a single AWS Cloud boundary, implying a single account. Consolidated billing benefits apply to AWS Organizations with multiple accounts. | If this architecture is part of a larger enterprise, consolidate billing under an AWS Organization to leverage volume discounts and simplify billing management. |
| **4. Automation** | Recommend architectural adjustments for cost efficiency | Needs Refinement | The current architecture is a well-established serverless pattern. Further optimizations are usually configuration-based or involve adding caching layers. | **API Gateway Caching:** Implement API Gateway caching for frequently accessed, non-dynamic data to reduce Lambda invocations and DynamoDB reads. **Lambda Optimization:** Fine-tune Lambda function memory settings to the optimal balance between performance and cost. Explore Graviton2 processors for Lambda for potential cost savings. **Data Transfer:** Minimize cross-region data transfer if components were distributed across regions (not depicted). |

### Gaps

| Missing Information Category | Details and Impact on Cost Optimization Analysis |
|---|---|
| **Usage Metrics** | Actual data on request volume, execution duration, memory usage, and data storage/throughput is critical for identifying over-provisioning and idle resources. Without this, recommendations are generic. |
| **Configuration Details** | Specific Lambda memory settings, DynamoDB capacity mode (On-Demand vs. Provisioned) and its auto-scaling configurations, Amplify specific build/hosting settings are unknown. These details directly impact costs. |
| **Business Requirements/Traffic Patterns** | Understanding the application's expected load, peak times, and steady state is essential for making precise recommendations (e.g., for DynamoDB capacity planning). |
| **Organizational Context** | Information about existing AWS Organizations, tagging policies, budgeting practices, and governance frameworks is missing, which impacts recommendations related to consolidated billing, cost allocation, and monitoring. |
| **Data Access Patterns (DynamoDB)** | Knowing how data is read/written (e.g., highly frequent reads to specific items, infrequent archival data) would help determine the applicability of DynamoDB Standard-IA. |
| **Caching Strategy** | Whether any caching mechanisms (e.g., CloudFront for Amplify, API Gateway caching) are already in place is not visible, which could reduce subsequent service costs. |
| **Logging and Monitoring Setup** | Details on CloudWatch logs retention, custom metrics, and alarm configurations would show how effectively costs are being observed and managed. |
