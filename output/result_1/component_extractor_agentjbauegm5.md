| Gaps | Layer | Missing Component | Rationale | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Missing Load Balancer | Presentation | Application Load Balancer (ALB) / Network Load Balancer (NLB) | No explicit load balancing for the public-facing DSS nodes (Automation, Design, API Deployer) is shown, which is typical for resilient applications. | Medium |
| Missing Monitoring | Cross-cutting | Amazon CloudWatch | No explicit monitoring service is shown for collecting metrics and logs, crucial for operational visibility. | Medium |
| Missing Logging | Cross-cutting | AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs | No explicit logging services for API calls or network traffic are shown, which are vital for security and troubleshooting. | Medium |
| Missing Compute for DSS Nodes | Application | Specific EC2 instances, Fargate, etc. | While the icon suggests a compute instance, the specific AWS compute service (e.g., EC2, Fargate) for the "DSS" nodes is not explicitly named. | Low |
| Missing Data Store for DSS Nodes | Data | Database (RDS, DynamoDB) / Cache (ElastiCache) | The architecture shows processing nodes but no explicit operational database or cache for their data persistence or session management. | Medium |
| Missing CI/CD components | Cross-cutting | CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline | No components for continuous integration/continuous delivery are shown, which are common for deploying applications like the DSS nodes. | Low |
