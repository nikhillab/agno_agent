| Practice | Check | Status | Notes | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Observability** | Verify monitoring & alerting for key metrics, events | Not Evident | The diagram does not explicitly show any monitoring or alerting services. | Implement AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logs, configure alarms for key operational metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, network I/O, service health). |
| | Check log aggregation and tracing | Not Evident | No explicit services for centralized log aggregation (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, Kinesis Firehose to S3/OpenSearch) or distributed tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray) are depicted. | Establish a centralized logging solution using AWS CloudWatch Logs and potentially Kinesis Firehose to S3 or OpenSearch for analysis. Consider AWS X-Ray for application tracing. |
| **Automation** | Assess deployment pipeline automation | Limited | "DSS Automation Node" and "DSS API Deployer" are present, suggesting some automation. However, a full CI/CD pipeline is not detailed. | Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using services like AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. |
| | Confirm rollback and versioning strategies | Not Evident | The diagram does not provide information about rollback mechanisms or versioning strategies for deployments. | Integrate automatic rollback capabilities into the deployment pipeline. Utilize versioning for application artifacts (e.g., S3, ECR) and infrastructure as code (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform). |
| **Feedback & Improvement** | Check for post-incident reviews | Not Evident | These are organizational process practices and cannot be inferred from an architecture diagram. | Establish a formal process for conducting post-incident reviews to identify root causes and preventive actions. |
| | Verify continuous improvement processes | Not Evident | These are organizational process practices and cannot be inferred from an architecture diagram. | Implement a continuous improvement loop, incorporating feedback from monitoring, incidents, and reviews into future architectural and operational enhancements. |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Assess multi-AZ/region strategy for resilience | Absent | The diagram shows a single "Availability Zone," indicating a lack of multi-AZ deployment for critical components. | Re-architect critical components (DSS Nodes, EKS, Redshift, EMR) across multiple Availability Zones within the region for high availability and resilience. Consider a multi-region strategy for critical workloads. |
| | Check for backup and restore strategies | Not Evident | No explicit backup solutions (e.g., AWS Backup, EBS Snapshots, RDS Snapshots) are shown. | Implement automated backup and restore procedures for all data stores (Redshift, EMR data, S3 objects, EKS persistent volumes) and critical application configurations. |

**Gaps Table**

| Missing Aspect | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Explicit Monitoring & Logging Solutions** | Lack of visibility into application performance, resource utilization, and operational health, leading to reactive troubleshooting and extended downtime. |
| **Detailed CI/CD Pipeline** | Manual or semi-manual deployments increase the risk of errors, reduce deployment frequency, and hinder rapid recovery or scaling. |
| **Multi-AZ/Region Resilience** | Single point of failure within the Availability Zone, leading to complete system downtime in case of an AZ outage. |
| **Automated Backup & Recovery Procedures** | Potential for data loss and prolonged recovery times in the event of data corruption, accidental deletion, or service failure. |
| **Defined Runbooks/SOPs** | Without clear operational procedures, response to incidents may be inconsistent, slow, or ineffective. (Not directly assessed, but a general operational gap when automation is limited). |
| **Clear Feedback Loop & Improvement Process** | Inability to systematically learn from operational events and continuously improve the system's reliability, efficiency, and security posture. |
