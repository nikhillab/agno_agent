| Aspect | Check | Status | Notes | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Compute** | Verify right-sized instances or containers | Cannot verify | Diagram lacks specific instance types or container resource definitions for DSS Nodes, EKS, EMR, Redshift. | Implement a process for continuous right-sizing (e.g., AWS Compute Optimizer, CloudWatch metrics) for all compute resources. |
| **Compute** | Check use of serverless or managed services where appropriate | Partial | Good use of managed services (Redshift, EMR, EKS) and serverless (Glue, Athena, SageMaker, Rekognition, Comprehend). "DSS" nodes are generic. | Evaluate if the "DSS Automation Node," "DSS Design Node," and "DSS API Deployer" can leverage more serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda, Fargate) or managed (e.g., AWS App Runner) services for better operational efficiency and cost savings, depending on their workload characteristics. |
| **Compute** | Maximize utilization | Cannot verify | Utilization cannot be assessed from a static architecture diagram. | Implement comprehensive monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch) to track CPU, memory, and network utilization of all compute resources and adjust scaling/sizing accordingly. |
| **Scaling & Elasticity** | Confirm autoscaling policies | Not evident | Autoscaling policies are not explicitly shown for the "DSS" nodes. While EKS, EMR, Redshift have inherent scaling capabilities, specific policies are not detailed. | Implement Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) for the "DSS" nodes to ensure automatic scaling based on demand and improve resilience. Define clear scaling policies for EKS node groups, EMR, and Redshift. |
| **Scaling & Elasticity** | Verify horizontal vs vertical scaling strategies | Partial | Horizontal scaling is implied for EKS, EMR, and Redshift. Horizontal scaling for "DSS" nodes is not apparent without ASGs and Load Balancers. Vertical scaling (instance type changes) is not visible. | Implement horizontal scaling for "DSS" nodes using ASGs behind a Load Balancer. Establish a strategy for vertical scaling for managed services where applicable, or when horizontal scaling is not feasible. |
| **Scaling & Elasticity** | Democratize advanced technologies | Good | The architecture uses advanced AWS services like EMR, EKS, SageMaker, Rekognition, Comprehend, Glue, and Athena. | Continue leveraging managed and serverless services for advanced capabilities to reduce operational overhead. |
| **Caching & CDN** | Assess use of caching layers (Redis, Memcached) | Not implemented | No caching services (e.g., Amazon ElastiCache) are shown in the architecture. | Assess the need for caching layers (e.g., ElastiCache for Redis or Memcached) to reduce database/compute load and improve response times for frequently accessed data. |
| **Caching & CDN** | Check CDN usage for static assets | Not implemented | No Content Delivery Network (e.g., Amazon CloudFront) is shown. | Implement Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, especially if the "DSS API Deployer" serves static assets or requires edge acceleration for APIs. |
| **Data Storage** | Ensure appropriate storage tiers (SSD vs HDD, S3 lifecycle) | Partial | S3 is used, which supports various storage classes, but specific lifecycle policies are not shown. Redshift and EMR storage depends on configuration. | Implement S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition data to appropriate storage classes (e.g., S3 Standard-IA, S3 Glacier) based on access patterns for cost optimization and sustainability. Review storage configurations for EMR and Redshift for optimal performance and cost. |
| **Data Storage** | Verify database performance options (Aurora, DynamoDB DB, etc.) | Not applicable | Redshift is a data warehouse. No operational databases (OLTP) like Aurora, DynamoDB, or RDS are shown for the "DSS" application components. | Identify the database requirements for the "DSS Automation Node," "DSS Design Node," and "DSS API Deployer." Implement an appropriate operational database (e.g., Amazon RDS Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB) based on performance, scalability, and availability needs. |

### Gaps

| Missing Aspect | Importance |
|---|---|
| **High Availability / Multi-AZ Deployment** | The entire architecture is within a single Availability Zone, posing a single point of failure for all services. Critical for resilience. |
| **Load Balancers (e.g., ALB/NLB)** | No Load Balancers are shown, which are essential for distributing traffic, enabling horizontal scaling, and improving fault tolerance for the "DSS" nodes. |
| **Operational Database** | An operational database (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB) is typically needed for application state, user data, or configuration managed by the "DSS" nodes. |
| **Monitoring and Logging** | No explicit mention or depiction of monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch, X-Ray) or logging (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail) services. Essential for operational visibility, performance analysis, and troubleshooting. |
| **VPC Endpoints** | For private connectivity to AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, Sagemaker, etc.) from the VPC, which can improve security and potentially performance by keeping traffic within the AWS network. |
| **Disaster Recovery Strategy** | No components or patterns for disaster recovery (e.g., cross-region replication) are depicted. |
