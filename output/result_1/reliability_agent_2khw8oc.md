| Fault Tolerance | Verify multi-AZ or multi-region deployment | Not Multi-AZ                | All components (VPC, subnets, DSS nodes, Redshift, EMR, EKS) are depicted within a single "Availability Zone" boundary.                                               | Implement multi-AZ deployment for critical components (DSS nodes, Redshift, EMR, EKS) to ensure resilience against Availability Zone failures. Utilize multi-AZ features of managed services and distribute instances across multiple AZs.                                                                                                    |
| Fault Tolerance | Check load balancer health checks         | Not depicted                | No load balancers (e.g., ALB/NLB) are shown in front of the DSS nodes or EKS clusters to distribute traffic and perform health checks.                              | Introduce load balancers for the DSS nodes (if user-facing) and EKS services to enable health checks, automated traffic redirection from unhealthy instances, and load distribution across multiple instances/nodes.                                                                                                                         |
| Backup & Recovery | Confirm backups are configured for data stores | Partially verifiable        | Amazon Redshift provides automatic snapshots by default. S3 is highly durable. Explicit backup configurations (e.g., retention, cross-region copies) for DSS nodes' data, EKS persistent volumes, or specific EMR data stores are not shown. | Configure comprehensive backup strategies for DSS node data (e.g., EBS snapshots, AMIs), EKS persistent volumes, and ensure Redshift snapshots have appropriate retention policies and cross-region replication if required. Leverage AWS Backup for centralized management.                                                                      |
| Backup & Recovery | Verify recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO) | Not verifiable              | RTO/RPO are operational metrics and depend on specific configurations and testing, which cannot be assessed from a static architecture diagram.                     | Define and document clear RTO/RPO for all critical services and data stores. Design recovery strategies (e.g., pilot light, warm standby) that align with these objectives.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Self-Healing    | Assess automated restart or failover mechanisms | Limited / Not fully depicted | Managed services (Redshift, EMR, EKS control plane) offer some inherent self-healing. However, explicit mechanisms like Auto Scaling Groups for DSS nodes or EKS worker nodes are not shown for automated instance restarts or failover. | Implement Auto Scaling Groups for DSS nodes and EKS worker nodes to enable automated recovery from instance failures, dynamic scaling, and distribution across multiple Availability Zones. For managed services, leverage their built-in high availability features and multi-AZ deployments.                                                     |
| Self-Healing    | Check circuit breakers or retry logic     | Not verifiable              | Circuit breakers and retry logic are application-level design patterns or library configurations that are not visible in an infrastructure diagram.                  | Implement circuit breaker patterns and retry logic within application code (e.g., DSS components, applications running on EKS) to gracefully handle transient failures and prevent cascading failures across interconnected services.                                                                                                    |
| Self-Healing    | Test recovery procedures                  | Not verifiable              | Testing recovery procedures is an operational activity that cannot be assessed from an architectural diagram.                                                     | Regularly conduct disaster recovery drills and game days to validate recovery procedures, measure actual RTO/RPO, identify weaknesses, and continuously improve the system's resilience and operational readiness.                                                                                                                           |
| Capacity Planning | Ensure service limits are monitored       | Not verifiable              | Monitoring AWS service limits is an operational aspect and requires monitoring tools and alerts, which are not depicted in the diagram.                           | Implement AWS Service Quotas monitoring and CloudWatch alarms for critical service limits to proactively detect approaching limits and request increases before they impact system availability or performance.                                                                                                                              |
| Capacity Planning | Verify capacity buffers for peak loads    | Not explicitly shown        | DSS nodes appear to be fixed capacity. While managed services can scale, explicit auto-scaling policies or current capacity buffers are not visible.                | Implement auto-scaling for DSS nodes and EKS worker nodes based on demand to ensure sufficient capacity for peak loads while optimizing costs. For Redshift and EMR, configure scaling policies or monitor usage to provision adequate capacity and account for growth.                                                                         |

| :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-AZ/Region Deployment**            | The entire architecture is contained within a single Availability Zone, posing a single point of failure for AZ-level outages.                                                                                  |
| **Load Balancers**                        | No load balancers are shown for the DSS nodes, which are typically critical for distributing traffic, health checking, and improving fault tolerance for web/API tiers.                                         |
| **Auto Scaling Groups**                   | Absent for the DSS nodes and EKS worker nodes, which are crucial for automated instance replacement on failure and dynamic scaling to meet demand fluctuations.                                              |
| **Monitoring & Logging**                  | No explicit mention or depiction of CloudWatch, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, or other monitoring, logging, and alerting services, which are fundamental for operational visibility and proactive issue detection. |
| **Well-defined Backup Policies**          | While some services have defaults, explicit backup policies (e.g., retention periods, cross-region replication for disaster recovery) are not detailed for all relevant data stores.                            |
| **Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy**       | Beyond multi-AZ, no comprehensive multi-region DR strategy or components are implied, which would be essential for protection against regional disasters.                                                   |
