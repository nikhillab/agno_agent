| Area | Check | Status | Notes | Remediation (if FAIL) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. IAM and Security foundations** | Check for least-privilege policies | N/A | Diagram does not provide details on IAM policies. | Review and implement least-privilege IAM policies for all roles and users accessing AWS resources. |
| | Verify use of roles over long-term keys | N/A | Diagram does not show how applications/services (DSS nodes, EKS, EMR) authenticate to AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, etc.). | Ensure all compute resources (EC2, EKS, EMR) use IAM roles for accessing AWS services, rather than long-term access keys. |
| | Confirm MFA enforcement | N/A | Diagram does not show user access or authentication mechanisms. | Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users, especially root account and privileged users. |
| **2. Network Security** | Assess security groups and NACLs | PARTIAL FAIL | Security groups and Network ACLs are present, but specific rules are not visible. Public subnet contains sensitive nodes. | Thoroughly review all Security Group and Network ACL rules to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege, allowing only necessary ingress/egress traffic. Specifically, restrict inbound access to public-facing components. |
| | Ensure no unintended public exposure | PARTIAL FAIL | "DSS API Deployer" is located in a Public subnet, implying direct public exposure without visible protective layers like an API Gateway or WAF. | For the DSS API Deployer, consider placing it behind an API Gateway with integrated WAF, or at minimum, an Application Load Balancer with WAF and strict Security Group rules. Restrict direct public access to administrative ports on all public instances. |
| | Verify use of firewalls/WAF where applicable | FAIL | No AWS WAF or other advanced firewall solutions (e.g., AWS Network Firewall) are explicitly shown protecting the public-facing components. | Implement AWS WAF for the public-facing "DSS API Deployer" (if fronted by ALB/API Gateway) to protect against common web exploits. Consider AWS Network Firewall for centralized network traffic inspection. |
| **3. Data Protection** | Verify encryption at rest (KMS or equivalent) | N/A | Diagram does not explicitly indicate data encryption at rest for S3, Redshift, EMR, or EKS storage. | Ensure all data at rest in S3 (Bucket Encryption), Redshift, EMR, and EKS volumes (EBS encryption) is encrypted using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) or AWS Managed Keys. |
| | Verify encryption in transit (TLS) | N/A | Diagram does not explicitly indicate encryption in transit for data between services or client-to-service communication. | Ensure all data in transit uses TLS/SSL for communication between services (e.g., DSS nodes to S3, EKS to other services) and for client access to public-facing applications. |
| | Check secrets management (Vault, Key Vault, Secrets Manager) | FAIL | No dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store) is shown. | Implement AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for secure storage and rotation of application credentials and secrets. |
| **4. Detection & Monitoring** | Confirm audit logging is enabled (CloudTrail, X-ray, etc.) | FAIL | No audit logging services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs) are explicitly shown as enabled or configured. | Enable AWS CloudTrail for API activity logging across the account. Configure CloudWatch Logs for application and OS logs from DSS nodes, EKS, and EMR, with appropriate retention. |
| | Verify threat detection services (GuardDuty, WAF) | FAIL | AWS GuardDuty and AWS Config are not explicitly shown for threat detection and configuration compliance. WAF is also missing. | Enable AWS GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection. Implement AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings aggregation. Enable AWS Config for continuous monitoring of resource configurations against desired baselines. |
| **5. Incident Response** | Confirm that there is an incident response plan in place. | N/A | An architectural diagram cannot confirm the existence of an incident response plan. | Develop and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan, including roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and playbooks for common security incidents. |
| | Verify alerting on security events. | FAIL | No alerting mechanisms (e.g., CloudWatch Alarms, SNS) are shown integrated with logging or threat detection. | Configure CloudWatch Alarms based on security-related CloudTrail events and GuardDuty findings to notify relevant teams via SNS. |
| | Verify that logs are retained according to compliance requirements. | N/A | Log retention policies are not depicted in the diagram. | Define and implement log retention policies in CloudWatch Logs and S3 (for CloudTrail logs) to meet compliance requirements. |
| **6. Infrastructure protection** | Patch management for compute instances | N/A | Diagram does not show patch management for DSS nodes or underlying EKS/EMR instances. | Implement AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching of EC2 instances (DSS nodes). |
| | Vulnerability scanning | N/A | No vulnerability scanning service is depicted. | Implement Amazon Inspector for continuous vulnerability scanning and compliance assessment of EC2 instances. |
| | DDoS protection | N/A | While AWS Shield Standard is automatic, no advanced DDoS protection is explicitly indicated. | Consider AWS Shield Advanced for enhanced DDoS protection, especially for the public-facing API Deployer, in conjunction with AWS WAF. |
| **7. Application security** | Code security | N/A | Diagram does not provide details on application code or development practices. | Implement secure coding practices, conduct regular code reviews, and integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) into CI/CD pipelines. |
| | API security | PARTIAL FAIL | The "DSS API Deployer" in a public subnet without explicit API Gateway or WAF suggests potential API security weaknesses. | Secure the API endpoints exposed by the "DSS API Deployer" using AWS API Gateway with robust authentication, authorization, throttling, and AWS WAF integration. Implement proper input validation and error handling within the application. |

**Gaps and Missing Components:**

| Category | Missing Component/Consideration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** | **NAT Gateway / VPC Endpoints** | If private subnet resources (Redshift, EMR, EKS) need to initiate outbound connections to the internet or other AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, etc.) in a private manner, a NAT Gateway (for internet) or VPC Endpoints (for AWS services) would be required and are not shown. Currently, access to AWS services from the private subnet is implicitly assumed to be via public endpoints, which is less secure, or via a NAT Gateway not shown. |
| | **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | No load balancer is shown in front of the DSS nodes in the public subnet for distributing traffic, health checks, and SSL termination. |
| | **Bastion Host / VPN** | No secure administrative access method (e.g., bastion host in a public subnet, VPN connection to a private subnet) is depicted. Direct SSH/RDP to public instances is a risk. |
| **Data Protection** | **Backup & Restore Strategy** | No explicit backup strategy for data in Redshift, EMR, S3, or EKS volumes is shown. |
| | **Data Classification** | No indication of data classification, which is crucial for applying appropriate security controls. |
| **Detection & Monitoring** | **AWS Security Hub** | For centralized security findings aggregation and management. |
| | **AWS Config** | For continuous monitoring and assessment of resource configurations against desired baselines. |
| | **VPC Flow Logs** | For capturing detailed network traffic information (source/destination IP, port, protocol) within the VPC. |
| **High Availability/Resilience** | **Multi-AZ Deployment** | The architecture is constrained to a single Availability Zone, posing a single point of failure. |
| **Compliance** | **Compliance Standards** | No mention of specific compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2) this architecture needs to adhere to, which would dictate additional controls. |
