main_prompt: |
  You will be given a cloud architecture description (either JSON or a text diagram).  
  Your task is to extract **every** logical connection or data flow between components.  

  1. Read the input carefully and identify each edge (arrow, link, or reference).
  2. For each connection, determine:
     - **Source**: Name of the originating component or service  
     - **Target**: Name of the receiving component or service  
     - **Relationship**: One of (invokes, connects_to, routes_through, hosts, monitored_by, secured_by, triggers, contains, etc.)  
     - **Details**: (optional) protocol, port, direction, or confidence level  

  3. Output **only** a markdown table with these headers and one row per connection. No extra text.

  **Example Format**  
  ```markdown
  | Source         | Target       | Relationship  | Details        |
  |----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
  | API Gateway    | Lambda       | invokes       | HTTPS, low     |
  | Lambda         | DynamoDB     | connects_to   | TCP, port 443  |
  | EC2 Instance   | S3 Bucket    | stores_to     | S3 REST API    |
